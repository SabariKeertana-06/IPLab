                Christ the Redeemer, a colossal iconic statue of Jesus Christ, stands atop the Corcovado mountain <br>
                overlooking Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Completed in 1931, this magnificent sculpture is a symbol of <br>
                Brazilian Christianity and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Designed by Heitor da Silva Costa and <br>
                sculpted by Paul Landowski, the statue rises 30 meters (98 feet) and spans 28 meters (92 feet) from <br>
                fingertip to fingertip. Its outstretched arms convey a sense of divine embrace, and the panoramic <br>
                views from the summit offer a breathtaking panorama of the city and its natural surroundings. Christ <br>
                the Redeemer is a testament to the intersection of faith, art, and engineering, drawing millions of visitors <br>
                who are captivated by its spiritual significance and commanding presence against the backdrop of Rio's <br>
                picturesque landscape.
